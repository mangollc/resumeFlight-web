  "description": "MissionThe all-in-one service to save time, money, and stress on health insurance and medical bills.Medical bills are a massive problem. They are confusing, over 40% contain errors, 17% of claims are denied by insurance, and often represent very large sums of money. As a result, 100 million Americans are saddled with medical debt, and medical bills cause nearly 70% of personal bankruptcies in the US.Dealing with unexpectedly high medical bills is time-consuming, complex, and stressful. Stuck between their providers, payers, and bill collectors, consumers too frequently have to make numerous phone calls, wait on hold, and even send paper letters and faxes. Appealing insurance denials, resolving billing errors, negotiating bills, and filing out-of-network claims require expert knowledge that most consumers don't have.Thanks to AI and new healthcare regulations around data access and price transparency, we can now automate this soul-crushing work and empower consumers to fight back against this broken system. Beyond medical bills, we help people through their entire healthcare journey as they pick their health insurance plans and benefits, or look for care that fits their budget.TeamMedBill AI is founded by 2 Oscar Health veterans, the first health insurance company built around a full stack technology platform and a relentless focus on serving its members. We joined Oscar pre-product, stayed through the IPO and helped it grow to over 1M members. We've worked across Oscar's entire stack and led many key projects, including its in-house telemedicine platform and claim system, positioning us uniquely to take on MedBill AI. We're proud of how Oscar raised the bar for what people should expect from their health insurance, and we’re excited to have an even larger impact with MedBill AI by taking the side of consumers unequivocally, regardless of their health insurance.We’re lucky to be backed by the founders and investors at Hugging Face, Oscar Health, TrueBill, CaseText, Forerunner Ventures, Red Sea Ventures, RRE Ventures, and much more.
