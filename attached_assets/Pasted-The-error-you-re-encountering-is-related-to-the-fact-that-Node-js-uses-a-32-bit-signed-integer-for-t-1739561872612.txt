The error you're encountering is related to the fact that Node.js uses a 32-bit signed integer for timeout durations, which means the maximum allowable value for a timeout in milliseconds is **2,147,483,647** (which corresponds to about 24.8 days). If you attempt to set a timeout with a value larger than this, Node.js will throw a `TimeoutOverflowWarning` and default the timeout to `1ms`.

### Error Breakdown:
- **Error Message**: `(node:3686) TimeoutOverflowWarning: 112509107531 does not fit into a 32-bit signed integer.`
  - The number `112509107531` represents the timeout duration in milliseconds that you're trying to set.
  - This value exceeds the maximum limit of a 32-bit signed integer (`2,147,483,647`).
  - As a result, Node.js automatically sets the timeout to `1ms`, which is likely causing unexpected behavior in your application.

---

### Possible Causes:
1. **Incorrect Timeout Value**:
   - You may have accidentally passed an excessively large number as the timeout value. This could happen if the value is dynamically calculated or fetched from an external source (e.g., a database or API).

2. **Misconfigured Logic**:
   - If the timeout value is being calculated based on some logic (e.g., multiplying seconds by 1000 to convert to milliseconds), there might be a bug in the calculation that results in an unexpectedly large number.

3. **External Input**:
   - If the timeout value is derived from user input or an external configuration file, it might contain an invalid or unintended value.

### Solution Steps:

#### 1. **Identify the Source of the Timeout Value**
   - Locate where the timeout value is being set in your code. Look for any `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, or similar functions.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log("This will run after the timeout");
     }, timeoutValue); // Check the value of `timeoutValue`
     ```

   - Log the value of `timeoutValue` to ensure it is within the valid range:
     ```javascript
     console.log("Timeout value:", timeoutValue);
     ```

#### 2. **Validate the Timeout Value**
   - Before setting the timeout, validate that the value is within the acceptable range:
     ```javascript
     const MAX_TIMEOUT = 2147483647; // Maximum 32-bit signed integer

     if (timeoutValue > MAX_TIMEOUT) {
       console.error("Invalid timeout value:", timeoutValue);
       timeoutValue = MAX_TIMEOUT; // Cap the value to the maximum allowed
     }

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log("This will run after the timeout");
     }, timeoutValue);
     ```

#### 3. **Check for Calculation Errors**
   - If the timeout value is calculated dynamically, review the logic to ensure it doesn't produce excessively large numbers. For example:
     ```javascript
     const seconds = 1000000; // Example input
     const timeoutValue = seconds * 1000; // Convert to milliseconds

     if (timeoutValue > MAX_TIMEOUT) {
       console.error("Calculated timeout value is too large:", timeoutValue);
       timeoutValue = MAX_TIMEOUT; // Cap the value
     }
     ```

#### 4. **Handle External Input Safely**
   - If the timeout value comes from user input or an external source, sanitize and validate it before using it:
     ```javascript
     const userInput = "112509107531"; // Example input from user
     let timeoutValue = parseInt(userInput, 10);

     if (isNaN(timeoutValue) || timeoutValue > MAX_TIMEOUT) {
       console.error("Invalid or unsafe timeout value:", timeoutValue);
       timeoutValue = MAX_TIMEOUT; // Use a safe default
     }

     setTimeout(() => {
       console.log("This will run after the timeout");
     }, timeoutValue);
     ```

#### 5. **Debugging and Testing**
   - Add logging to track the flow of data and identify where the invalid value is introduced.
   - Test your application with various inputs to ensure the timeout logic behaves as expected.

### Additional Notes:
- If you need to handle delays longer than 24.8 days, consider breaking the delay into smaller chunks and chaining multiple timeouts:
  ```javascript
  function longTimeout(callback, totalDelay) {
    const MAX_DELAY = 2147483647;
    if (totalDelay > MAX_DELAY) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        longTimeout(callback, totalDelay - MAX_DELAY);
      }, MAX_DELAY);
    } else {
      setTimeout(callback, totalDelay);
    }
  }

  // Usage
  longTimeout(() => {
    console.log("This will run after a very long delay");
  }, 112509107531);
  ```

---

### Conclusion:
The root cause of the issue is an excessively large timeout value exceeding the 32-bit signed integer limit. By validating and capping the timeout value, you can prevent this error from occurring. Additionally, ensure that your logic for calculating or fetching the timeout value is robust and handles edge cases appropriately.
